        - Fixed a MAJOR bug in which the spawned scp process was being killed by
          the parent instead of waiting for the operation to complete.  Thanks to
          Ruban Phukan for the spot and *many* thanks to J. David Blackstone for
          the fix.

        - Some work on the test program - almost complete.

        - Removed a lame -e check that was causing metacharacters to fail.  Any type
          of non-existent file error will now be treated like any other error.

        - Modified the error handling yet again.  There were two problems that were
          worked out.  I'll just sum up by saying that it should work better now.

        - Documentation fixes and additions (thanks BbBoy)

        - Added an 'auto_yes' option/method so that you can automatically send
          'yes' to any 'yes/no' questions you may receive before finally sending
          your password (for first time connections, etc).
        
        - Added a 'no_check' option to help speed up scp calls by up to 2 seconds
          per call.  Use this only if you're absolutely certain everything is
          set up correctly.

        - Created separate timeouts for the 'auto_yes' and 'no_check' options, called
          'timeout_auto', and 'timeout_err', respectively.  I set their defaults
          to 1 second (which should be plenty) to improve speed.

        - The error_handler will now trap errors in the 'expect' call as well as
          the 'scp' call.

        - The -q option is *actually* being passed automatically now (oops).  Don't
          fret - this made no difference in any of the testing that I actually did,
          but there it is for you.

        - Added better error handling in the event that a call to 'scp()' fails

        - Added an 'error_handler' option/method so that programmers can trap
          and deal with failed 'scp' calls on their own terms.  Just make sure
          to die, croak, exit, etc. or your program may hang while waiting for
          terminal input.

        - The -e file test is no longer applied in a remote-to-local scenario

        - If a login is supplied, then that login is now automatically
          prepended to the host name, e.g. 'host:file.txt' becomes
          'login@host:file.txt', instead of using the current host name. Thanks
          to Guoben Li for the report.

        - Regarding the above comment, there is a lot more automatic parsing
          in general so that you can use less verbose syntax if you want.  See
          the scp method for what now passes as valid syntax.

        - Tested with Expect 1.15 - seems to work

        - Fixed this distro so that it unpacks correctly. :)
