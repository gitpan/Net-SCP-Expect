        - The -e file test is no longer applied in a remote-to-local scenario

        - If a login is supplied, then that login is now automatically
          prepended to the host name, e.g. 'host:file.txt' becomes
          'login@host:file.txt', instead of using the current host name. Thanks
          to Guoben Li for the report.

        - Regarding the above comment, there is a lot more automatic parsing
          in general so that you can use less verbose syntax if you want.  See
          the scp method for what now passes as valid syntax.

        - Tested with Expect 1.15 - seems to work

        - Fixed this distro so that it unpacks correctly. :)
