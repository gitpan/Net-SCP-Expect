        - The -e file test is no longer applied in a remote-to-local scenario

        - If a login is supplied, then that login is now automatically
          prepended to the host name, e.g. 'host:file.txt' becomes
          'login@host:file.txt', instead of using the current host name. Thanks
          to Guoben Li for the report.

        - Regarding the above comment, there is a lot more automatic parsing
          in general so that you can use less verbose syntax if you want.  See
          the scp method for what now passes as valid syntax.

        - Tested with Expect 1.15 - seems to work

        - Fixed this distro so that it unpacks correctly. :)

        - Added better error handling in the event that a call to 'scp()' fails

        - Added an 'error_handler' option/method so that programmers can trap
          and deal with failed 'scp' calls on their own terms.  Just make sure
          to die, croak, exit, etc. or your program may hang while waiting for
          terminal input.
