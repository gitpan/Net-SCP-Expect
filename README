make test (optional)
make install

Potential problems:
===================

Large files don't copy
----------------------
Some folks have reported that large files either don't copy at all or will
only copy when run as root.  All I can tell you is that in my own tests,
copying a 40mb text file as a local (non-root) user worked fine.  I can only
guess that it may have something to do with either the version of scp/openssl
you are using or your setup.

Globbing doesn't work
---------------------
A couple folks have reported that trying to do something like
"scp('*.txt',host)" fails.  The test suite includes a glob test, as does
the interactive test, both of which work fine on my system.  This could
be related to the version of Perl that you are using (5.5.3 or earlier) or
perhaps your version of Expect.

It just seems to hang
---------------------
In some instances, specifying the wrong protocol can cause scp to hang,
although it should timeout eventually.  In one case, the itest.pl program
hung when scp'ing to a FreeBSD system.  I don't know the cause or the
workaround.

Reporting problems
------------------
If you are experiencing some sort of bug, please make sure that command-line
scp works as expected in order to rule out a problem with scp itself.

Otherwise, please include the following information with your bug report:

Perl version (perl -v output)
Platform
Expect version
SSH version of local and remote host (ssh -V)
Description of problem
Sample code, if possible
Your full name (for a possible future credit) and email address

The Interactive Test Script
===========================
I recommend deleting the test files after you've successfully completed the
itest.pl script.  There are about 50 mb worth of files, wasting space on
your filesystem.

See the itest/README file for more details.
